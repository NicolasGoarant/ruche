    manifeste_title: "Manifesto"
    constat_title: "The problem"
    constat_text: "In France, refugees face an administrative maze. Information is scattered, often opaque, sometimes contradictory. Support initiatives exist but remain invisible."
    reponse_title: "Our answer"
    reponse_text: "la Ruche brings together on a living platform everything that can help: rights, French classes, entrepreneurship, cultural events, testimonials. One place, up to date, geolocated, accessible."
    citoyenne_title: "Citizen-driven platform"
    citoyenne_text: "Everyone can contribute. Organizations, supportive citizens, refugees themselves: la Ruche is built collectively, like a real beehive."
    nom_title: "Why \"la Ruche\" (the Beehive)?"
    nom_text: "In a beehive, every bee has a role. Nobody builds alone. It's the collective, patient, determined work that creates something greater than oneself. That's exactly what we want to do: a space where everyone brings their contribution, however small."
