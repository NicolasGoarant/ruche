    hero_title_html: "Why <em>Les Tisserands?</em>"
    hero_subtitle: "Behind every tool, every map, every testimonial, there is a conviction: no one should have to rebuild their life alone."
    manifeste_intro: "In France, thousands of displaced people search every day to understand their rights, learn the language, and start a business. The information exists, but it is scattered, opaque, and often inaccessible."
    constat_title: "The problem"
    constat_p1: "When you arrive in a country where you don't speak the language or understand the administrative system, every step becomes an obstacle course. Where to file your asylum application? How to have your diploma recognized? Who can help you start a business? The answers exist, but they are scattered across institutional websites, local organizations, and little-known programs."
    constat_p2: "The result: qualified, motivated people ready to contribute to French society find themselves stuck — not for lack of will, but for lack of information."
    reponse_title: "Our answer"
    reponse_p1: "Les Tisserands brings together on a single platform everything a displaced person needs to know and find in order to move forward. Not just another institutional portal, not another static directory — a living space, powered by professionals and the community alike."
    reponse_p2: "Concretely, Les Tisserands is an interactive map of local resources, an AI-powered legal assistant to answer questions about your rights, and a space where anyone can share a French course, an event, a testimonial, or a business they've created."
    citoyenne_title: "A citizen-driven platform"
    citoyenne_p1: "Les Tisserands doesn't replace organizations or institutions. It makes them visible. It amplifies what already exists on the ground and fills the gaps in information."
    citoyenne_p2: "Above all, it gives a voice to those most concerned. Because integration isn't decreed from above: it's built by those who live it. The shares, journeys, stories of refugee entrepreneurs — all of it comes from the community, for the community."
    nom_title: "Why 'Les Tisserands' (The Weavers)?"
    nom_p1: "A weave is a fabric where every individual, however small, contributes to something greater than themselves. No weaver works alone. It's the collective work, the flow of information, the sharing of resources that give the fabric its strength."
    nom_highlight: "We believe that integration works the same way: every share counts, every voice enriches the whole."
    nom_p2: "A French course shared by a volunteer. A testimonial from an Afghan engineer who rebuilt her life. A cooking evening open to all. Each of these gestures, however modest, strengthens the network that helps others move forward."
    nom_caption: "Every voice enriches the weave."
    valeurs_title: "Our values"
    valeurs_subtitle: "What guides every decision, every feature, every line of code."
    valeur_accessibilite: "Radical accessibility"
    valeur_accessibilite_desc: "Information about rights should never be a privilege. Les Tisserands is free, open, and designed to be understood by someone learning French."
    valeur_horizontalite: "Horizontality"
    valeur_horizontalite_desc: "No hierarchy between those who 'help' and those who 'are helped.' On Les Tisserands, everyone can contribute, everyone can learn."
    valeur_ancrage: "Local roots"
    valeur_ancrage_desc: "Integration happens at the level of a neighborhood, a city, an organization. Les Tisserands geolocates resources so that help is concrete, not abstract."
    valeur_pouvoir: "Empowerment"
    valeur_pouvoir_desc: "We don't want to create dependence. Every tool on Les Tisserands — the legal assistant, the map, the journeys — aims to empower, not to assist."
    valeur_dignite: "Dignity"
    valeur_dignite_desc: "Displaced people are not 'cases.' They are engineers, cooks, artists, parents. Les Tisserands shows journeys, not statistics."
    valeur_opensource: "Open source"
    valeur_opensource_desc: "Les Tisserands is an open project. The code is public, the data is transparent. Because a citizen tool should belong to everyone."

    pour_qui_subtitle: "Les Tisserands is for anyone concerned with welcoming and integration."
